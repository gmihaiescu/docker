This layers all pancancer dependencies (aside from the workflows themselves, which are fairly big)  on top of a base SeqWare docker image

## Getting the image

There are two ways of getting the image:
* as a developer, you can build the image using the docker file
* as a user, download the image from Docker Hub

### Building the image

If you are building the container, you will require the seqware\_inside docker image on your system. 

1. Assuming docker is installed properly, build image with 
 
        docker build  -t seqware/seqware_full_pancancer .

### Downloading and restoring the image

1. Rather than building the image, you can also download and restore it from Docker Hub

        docker pull seqware/seqware_full_pancancer

## Running the Container

You will also require the tabix container in order to run the Sanger workflow. 

1. Create a working directory 

        mkdir ~/docker_working_dir
        cd ~/docker_working_dir 
        mkdir datastore
        mkdir workflows

2. Set permissions on datastore which will hold results of workflows after they run

         chmod a+w datastore

3. Run the tabix server as a named container if you have not already (see [tabix](../tabix)) 

4. Download and expand your workflows using the SeqWare unzip tool. Here we use Sanger as an example (you should probably pick a shared directory outside of this directory to avoid interfering with the Docker context if you need to rebuild the image). 

         cd workflows
         wget https://seqwaremaven.oicr.on.ca/artifactory/seqware-release/com/github/seqware/seqware-distribution/1.1.0-alpha.6/seqware-distribution-1.1.0-alpha.6-full.jar
         wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/oicr.workflow.bundles/released-bundles/Workflow_Bundle_SangerPancancerCgpCnIndelSnvStr_1.0.5_SeqWare_1.1.0-alpha.5.zip
         java -cp seqware-distribution-1.1.0-alpha.6-full.jar net.sourceforge.seqware.pipeline.tools.UnZip --input-zip Workflow_Bundle_SangerPancancerCgpCnIndelSnvStr_1.0.5_SeqWare_1.1.0-alpha.5.zip --output-dir  Workflow_Bundle_SangerPancancerCgpCnIndelSnvStr_1.0.5_SeqWare_1.1.0-alpha.5

5. Run container and login with the following (while persisting workflow run directories to datastore, and opening a secure link to the tabix server). Here we assume that a tabix container has already started, that you want to store your workflow results at /datastore and that the workflow that you wish to run (Sanger) is present in the workflows directory. Change these locations as required for your environment.  After this command you will be inside the running container.


         docker run --rm -h master -t --link pancancer_tabix_server:pancancer_tabix_server -v `pwd`/datastore:/datastore -v `pwd`/workflows/Workflow_Bundle_SangerPancancerCgpCnIndelSnvStr_1.0.5_SeqWare_1.1.0-alpha.5:/workflow  -i seqware_1.1.0-alpha.6_full_pancancer

6. Create an ini file (the contents of this will depend on your workflow). For testing purposes, you will require the following ini, note that the ip address for the tabix server will be injected into your environment variables as PANCANCER\_TABIX\_SERVER\_PORT\_80\_TCP\_ADDR based on the `--link parameter` above. Alternatively, you can use a tabix server running on a different host using its IP address.

         # not "true" means the data will be downloaded using AliquotIDs
         testMode=true
         # the server that has various tabix-indexed files on it, see above, update with your URL
         tabixSrvUri=http://172.17.0.13/   

7. Run workflow with oozie-sge with 

         seqware bundle launch --dir /workflow --ini workflow.ini

8. For running real workflows, you will be provided with a gnos pem key that should be installed to the scripts directory of the Sanger workflow.

## Saving the image

1. Exit the container and push the image to Docker Hub 

         exit
         docker push seqware/seqware_full_pancancer
